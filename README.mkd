This library implements parsers and encoders for email messages
([RFC 2045](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt) and
[RFC 2822](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt)), as well as mbox
files ([RFC 4155](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4155.txt)).

It was written by Victor Lopez Juan during his internship over the 
Summer of 2012.

The projects hosted under
[janestreet-alpha](https://github.com/janestreet-alpha) are libraries
and utilities that we hope the community will find useful. They have
been tested but not yet reviewed with the same level of scrutiny as
Jane Street's [core libraries](https://github.com/janestreet). Patches
are welcome.
